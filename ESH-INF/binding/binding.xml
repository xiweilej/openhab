	   Z-Wave is a wireless home automation protocol with reliable two way communications between nodes.
	   It supports a mesh network where mains powered nodes can route messages between nodes that could otherwise
	   not communicate with each other. The network supports hop distances of up to four hops.
	   <br/>
	   A wide range of devices are supported from lights, switches and sensors to smoke alarms, window coverings
	   and keyfobs. Z-Wave certification guarantees that certified devices will be compatible with each other and
	   the network.
