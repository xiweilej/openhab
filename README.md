# ZWave Binding
The ZWave binding supports an interface to a wireless ZWave home automation network. 

ZWave is a wireless home automation protocol with reliable two way communications between nodes. It supports a mesh network where mains powered nodes can route messages between nodes that could otherwise not communicate with each other. The network supports hop distances of up to four hops.

A wide range of devices are supported from lights, switches and sensors to smoke alarms, window coverings and keyfobs. ZWave certification guarantees that certified devices will be compatible with each other and the network. 

## Supported Things

### ZWave Serial Adapter

Before the binding can be used, a serial adapter must be added. This needs to be done manually. Select `Serial ZStick`, and enter the serial port.


## Discovery

Once the binding is authorized, and an adapter is added, it automatically reads all devices that are set up on the ZWave controller and puts them in the Inbox.
